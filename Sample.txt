Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool developed by HashiCorp. It enables users to define and provision infrastructure in a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, you can describe your infrastructure using a configuration file, and then deploy and manage that infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable manner.

Here are some key concepts and features of Terraform:

Declarative Configuration Language: Terraform uses a declarative language to define the desired state of your infrastructure. You describe the resources and their configurations in a configuration file, typically written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

Example of a simple Terraform configuration file (main.tf):
